## Functional Requirements

### Core PWM Functionality

#### Frequency Generation
The PWM controller supports a wide frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 MHz with exceptional precision. The frequency resolution is 24-bit, providing 0.1 Hz steps at low frequencies for fine control. The frequency accuracy is maintained at ±0.01% over the full temperature and voltage operating range. At the maximum frequency of 100 MHz, the jitter is kept below 100 ps RMS to ensure stable operation.

#### Duty Cycle Control
Duty cycle control spans from 0.001% to 100% with 16-bit resolution, enabling precise control of pulse width. The absolute accuracy is ±0.1% across the entire range. Duty cycle updates occur every PWM period, allowing for real-time adjustments without glitches or discontinuities.

#### Channel Configuration
The controller provides 8 independent PWM channels, each capable of operating in multiple modes. These include independent frequency and duty cycle control, synchronized frequency with independent duty cycles, master-slave synchronization for coordinated operation, and complementary outputs with configurable dead-time insertion for power applications.

### Advanced Features

#### Synchronization and Phase Control
Phase control provides 16-bit resolution with 0.01° steps, covering the full 0° to 360° range. The synchronization system supports multiple modes including internal PLL reference for standalone operation, external sync input for system-wide coordination, and cross-channel synchronization for multi-phase applications.

#### Safety and Protection
The safety system includes configurable dead-time insertion ranging from 0 to 65535 clock cycles to prevent shoot-through in power applications. Comprehensive fault detection monitors over-current, over-voltage, and over-temperature conditions. Emergency shutdown response time is under 100 nanoseconds for critical protection. A configurable watchdog timer provides timeout protection from 1ms to 1s.

#### Power Management
The design incorporates three distinct power domains: core logic operating at 1.2V, I/O buffers supporting 1.8V and 3.3V standards, and a dedicated 1.2V domain for the PLL. Sleep mode reduces standby current to less than 1 μA. Dynamic frequency scaling allows operation from 10% to 100% of the maximum frequency for power optimization.

Clock distribution implements a low-skew clock tree for synchronous operation across the chiplet. Signal routing minimizes cross-talk and delay to maintain signal integrity.

#### Interface Integration
Interface integration addresses four key requirements. Protocol compliance ensures adherence to APB4 standard interface specifications. Timing closure validates that all setup and hold requirements are met across the interface. Power management coordinates power states between the host and chiplet for efficient operation. Test access integration provides JTAG and scan chain capabilities for comprehensive testing and debugging.

### Software Integration
